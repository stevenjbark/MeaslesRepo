The Global Epidemic that Didn't Need to Be: Vaccination and Measles

The recent outbreak of communicable diseases including Measles has demonstrated the importance of immunization. Measles
vaccination is a two-injection regimen that provides >90% effective protection when administered properly. However, the
recent outbreaks suggest adherence to this immunization recommendation is failing, with concomitant increases in Measles
cases reported worldwide. Epidemics of this preventable disease are becoming commonplace.

This project will use multiple sources to evaluate and correlate recent outbreaks of Measles by country and global region, 
socioeconomic information, and the vaccination data available for these countries, regions, and populations.

# MeaslesRepo
Measles Vaccination and Correlation Repository


The ETL Project was completed and generated two main tables:
1. Measles_Vaccine_Correlation.html
2. Measles_MCV1_Vaccine_by_Years.html

These tables are extracte from World Health Organization data that are referenced in the MeaslesDataSets.txt in the MeaslesRepo_Raw folder.
The MeaslesRepo_Raw folder has all of the data, tables, and processing required for the analyses including the ipynb file and checkpoints.
I constructed a webpage for these data in the Webpage folder, which only has the files required for the webpage to display properly.
